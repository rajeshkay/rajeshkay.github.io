         <p>
            The brain controls our movements, stores our memories, and is the source of our
            thoughts, emotions, and language. The brain also controls many functions of the
            body, like breathing and digestion.
         </p>

         <p>
            To work properly, your brain needs oxygen. Your arteries deliver oxygen-rich blood
            to all parts of your brain. When something blocks blood supply to part of the brain
            or when a blood vessel bursts and that part of brain gets damaged, brain cells in
            that region start to die within minutes, because they canâ€™t get oxygen. This causes
            a stroke. A stroke can cause long-term disability, or even death.

            <br>

            The following webpages can provide a good start in better understanding
            of Stroke.

               <li><a href="https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/health-conditions/heart-health/reduce-your-risk-stroke">
                        Reducing the Risk of Stroke
                   </a></li>
               <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke">
                        Wikipedia - About Stroke
                   </a></li>
            </ul>


            Strokes can be classified into two major categories: 
            <ul>
               <li><b>Ischemic</b>: Ischemic strokes are caused by interruption of the blood 
                                    supply to the brain.
               </li>
               <li><b>Hemorrhagic</b>: Hemorrhagic strokes result from the rupture of a blood 
                                    vessel or an abnormal vascular structure.
               </li>

            </ul>

            About 87% of strokes are ischemic, the rest being hemorrhagic. Bleeding can develop 
            inside areas of ischemia, a condition known as "hemorrhagic transformation." It is 
            unknown how many hemorrhagic strokes actually start as ischemic strokes.

            <br>
            <br>

            <b>
            Strokes are a life-threatening emergency, and immediate medical attention is
            critical. When there is a doubt, one MUST consult a doctor immediately.

   <div class="factors">
         <h2 style="color: black;"><i>Risk Factors</i></h2>

         <div class = "known_factors" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
         <img src="data/known_factors.jpeg" alt="known_factors" class="known_factors" width="400">
         </div>

         <p>
            According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause
            of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. Over the years,
            several factors have been suspected to induce Stroke.

            <br>
            <br>

            The picture on the right captures the most prominent risk factors of stroke. <i>Are 
            there additional factors that can influence stroke?</i>

            <br>
            <br>

            For example, the lifetime risk of stroke is higher for women than men, with a 
            1 in 4 risk of stroke for women after age 25. So, <i> can <b>gender</b> be a factor or can 
            <b>age</b> be a factor?</i>
         </p>

   </div>

         <p>
            In this section we will explore the influence of some of the well known factors
            as well as some new factors that are not prominently shown in the picture.

         <ul>
             <li>High blood pressure</li>
             <li>Obesity</li>
             <li>Heart Disease</li>

            In the visualizations that follow, one can explore the <u>direct impact of these
            <i>new</i> factors</u> and also visualize the <u>influence of other risk factors when
            the dataset is categorized based on Age and Gender</u>.
            </b>
            <br>
            <br>

            A small dataset of about 250 stroke victims has been chosen for the purpose of this study.
         </p>

         <div id="chart1" class="chart1">
            <h3 style="color: black;" class="c1h3" id="c1h3"><center></center></h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>
            The below chart presents the total number of stroke victims in different age groups starting 
            from 30year olds through 90year olds. The dataset did not have any stroke victim above 90year 
            old and below 30year old. The total count of victims is further categorized by their gender. 

            <br>
            <br>

            The intent of this chart is to observe the direct influence of <b>Age</b> and 
            <b>Gender</b> in the onset of Stroke. This chart will be able to provide a clue 
            if <i>Females</i> are more prone to stroke than <i>Males</i> across all age 
            groups or across some of the age groups. 

            <br>
            <br>

            The x-axis of this chart shows different age groups. The y-axis of the chart provides the 
            count of stroke victims. For each age group, there is a bar for Male and another for Female 
            presenting the total count of stroke victims per Gender for each age group.

            <p>

            <b><u>Observation(s)</u>:</b> In the given dataset, it is evident that <i>Females</i> in the 
            age group of 50-60 and above 70years are more prone to having Stroke.

            Obesity and Diabetes are already identified as risk factors for Stroke. In this visualization, 
            one can observe the effect of these risk factors across Age and Gender.  

            <br>
            <br>

            The y-axis of the chart represents Age of the victim at the time of stroke. The x-axis indicates 
            the blood glucose levels. Higher blood glucose level indicates diabetes. BMI is a direct indication 
            of Obesity. The size of the marks (circles) indicate the BMI of the stroke victim. The largest 
            circle indicates obesity. 

            <br>
            <br>

            <i>
            This is an interactive chart. The reader can apply filters on different BMI levels or Gender or 
            both. These filters help visualize the effect of blood glucose level and obesity for different 
            gender and age.

            <b><u>Observation(s)</u>:</b> In the given dataset, we can visualize the following (by applying 
            filters - 
                <ul>
                    <li> Age is still a primary criteria for adults who are maintaining a Healthy Weight. 
                    However, adults who are heavier (Over Weight and/or Obese) are more prone to Stroke at
                    an younger age. This dataset also conveys that Obesity as a key Risk Factor.</li>
                    <li> The impact of person's weight appears uniform across both Gender. </li>
                    <li> It appears that blood sugar level alone is not the key factor in this dataset. 
                    Obesity appears to influence much more than blood sugar level (in this dataset).</li>

            This chart combines the other prominent factors like smoking , blood pressure and heart disease 
            along with a new factor - <i>Residence Type</i>.

            <br>
            <br>

            This is a bidirectional interactive chart. The x-axis of this chart shows different age groups. 
            The y-axis of the chart provides the count of stroke victims. For each age group, there is a bar 
            in the upward direction for Male and another for Female presenting the total count of stroke 
            victims per Gender for each age group. Based on the selection of <i>factor</i>, the downward 
            graph presents the distribution of victims for each in each factor.

            <br>
            <br>

            This dataset has the following information about these factors - 
            <ul>
               <li><a>Blood Pressure: The dataset contains information whether an individual has blood pressure or not.</a></li>

               <li><a>Heart Disease: The dataset contains presence or absence of heart disease.</a></li>
               <li><a>Smoking Status: There are 4 categories for smoking - stroke victim who is not a smoker, 
                        victim who is active smoker, someone who has smoked in the past and a few of them the 
                        smoking status is unknown. </a></li>

               <li><a>Residence Type: The Residence type has two values - if the victim was residing in an 
                        Urban area and Rural area. </a></li>
            </ul>

            <b><u>Observation(s)</u>:</b> In the given dataset, we can visualize the following (by applying 
            filters - 
                <ul>
                    <li><i>(Select) Smoking</i>: Across all age groups, it appears that active smoking is not the 
                    greatest risk factor. However, combining active smokers and past smokers count, smoking appears 
                    as risk factor for Males across all age group and Females in some age group (Females between 
                    50-70years of age). </li>
                    <li><i>Filter on Residence</i>: Across all age groups and gender, people living in Urban areas have 
                    suffered from stroke than people living in Rural. <u>Note</u>: This is an inference for the current 
                    dataset.</li>
                    <li><i>Filter on Heart Disease</i>: For the people in this dataset, there is no evidence that 
                    Heart Disease is a major risk factor for Stroke.</li>
                    <li><i>Filter on Blood Pressure</i>: For the people in this dataset, there is no evidence that 
                    Blood Pressure is a major risk factor for Stroke.</li>
