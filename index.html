         <p>
            The brain controls our movements, stores our memories, and is the source of our
            thoughts, emotions, and language. The brain also controls many functions of the
            body, like breathing and digestion.
         </p>

         <p>
            To work properly, your brain needs oxygen. Your arteries deliver oxygen-rich blood
            to all parts of your brain. When something blocks blood supply to part of the brain
            or when a blood vessel bursts and that part of brain gets damaged, brain cells in
            that region start to die within minutes, because they canâ€™t get oxygen. This causes
            a stroke. A stroke can cause long-term disability, or even death.

         <p>
            The following webpages can provide a good start in better understanding
            of Stroke.

            </ul>

         </p>
            Strokes can be classified into two major categories: 
            <ul>
               <li><b>Ischemic</b>: Ischemic strokes are caused by interruption of the blood 
                                    supply to the brain.
               </li>
               <li><b>Hemorrhagic</b>: Hemorrhagic strokes result from the rupture of a blood 
                                    vessel or an abnormal vascular structure.
               </li>

            </ul>

            About 87% of strokes are ischemic, the rest being hemorrhagic. Bleeding can develop 
            inside areas of ischemia, a condition known as "hemorrhagic transformation." It is 
            unknown how many hemorrhagic strokes actually start as ischemic strokes.
         </p>
         <p><b>
            Strokes are a life-threatening emergency, and immediate medical attention is
            critical. When there is a doubt, one MUST consult a doctor immediately.

         <h2 style="color: black;"><i>Risk Factors</i></h2>

         <p>
            According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause
            of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. Over the years,
            several factors have been suspected to induce Stroke.
         </p>
         <p>
            The picture on the right captures the most prominent risk factors of stroke. This
            is a very generalized and well known information. <i>Are there any additional factors
            that can influence stroke?</i>

            For example, the lifetime risk of stroke is higher for women than men, with a 
            1 in 4 risk of stroke for women after age 25. So, <i> can <b>gender</b> be a factor or can 
            <b>age</b> be a factor?</i>
         </p>


   </div>


   <div class="visualisation">
         <h2 style="color: black;"><i>Visualization of Common Factors</i></h2>
         <p>
            In this section we will explore the influence of some of the well known factors
            as well as some new factors that are not prominently shown in the picture.

         <ul>
             <li>Age <i>(factor not listed above)</i></li>
             <li>Gender <i>(factor not listed above)</i></li>
             <li>High blood pressure</li>
             <li>Obesity</li>
             <li>Heart Disease</li>
             <li>Smoking</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
            In the visualizations that follow, one can explore the direct impact of these
            <i>new</i> factors and also visualize the influence of other known factors when
            the dataset is categorized based on Age and Gender.
         </p>
         <p>
            For the purpose of this study, a small dataset of about 250 stroke victims is chosen.
         </p>

         <div id="chart1" class="chart1">
            <h3 style="color: black;" class="c1h3" id="c1h3"><center></center></h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>
            The below chart presents the total number of stroke victims in different age groups starting from 30year olds through 90year olds. The dataset did not have any stroke victim above 90year old and below 30year old. The total count of victims is further categorized by their gender. 
            </p>

            <p>
            The intent of this chart is to observe the direct influence of <b>Age</b> and 
            <b>Gender</b> in the onset of Stroke. This chart will be able to provide a clue 
            if <i>Females</i> are more prone to stroke than <i>Males</i> across all age 
            groups or across some of the age groups.
            </p>

            <svg class="c1svg1" id="c1svg1" width="600" height="600"><center></center> </svg>

            <p>

            <b><u>Conclusion</u>:</b> In the given dataset, it is evident that <i>Females</i> in the age group of 50-60 and above 70years are more prone to having Stroke.
            </p>

            <p></p>
            <p>
            Obesity and Diabetes are already identified as risk factors for Stroke. In this visualization, one can observe the effect of these risk factors across Age and Gender.  
            </p>
            <p>
The y-axis of the chart represents Age of the victim at the time of stroke. The x-axis indicates the blood glucose levels. Higher blood glucose level indicates diabetes. BMI is a direct indication of Obesity. The size of the marks (circles) indicate the BMI of the stroke victim. The largest circle indicates obesity. 
            </p>
            <p><i>
This is an interactive chart. The reader can apply filters on different BMI levels and Gender. The filters can be a combination of both these parameters as well.
