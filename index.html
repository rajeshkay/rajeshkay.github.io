         <p>
            This page is intended to give an overview about Stroke. It also provides a brief
            summary of the various known risk factors that can induce a stroke. More importantly,
            <u> this page offers the viewers an opportunity to visualize and better understand the
            statistical distribution of the various factors of stroke among a small subset of victims
            belonging to different age groups</u>.

         <h2><i>What is Stroke?</i></h2>
         <p>
            The brain controls our movements, stores our memories, and is the source of our 
            thoughts, emotions, and language. The brain also controls many functions of the 
            body, like breathing and digestion.
         </p>

         <p>
            To work properly, your brain needs oxygen. Your arteries deliver oxygen-rich blood 
            to all parts of your brain. When something blocks blood supply to part of the brain 
            or when a blood vessel bursts and that part of brain gets damaged, brain cells in 
            that region start to die within minutes, because they canâ€™t get oxygen. This causes 
            a stroke. A stroke can cause long-term disability, or even death.
         </p>

            Strokes are a life-threatening emergency, and immediate medical attention is 
            critical. The following webpages can provide a good start in better understanding 
            of Stroke.

         <h2><i>Risk Factors</i></h2>
         <p>
            According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause
            of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. Over the years, 
            several factors have been suspected to induce Stroke.

         <h2><i>Common Factors</i></h2>
         <p>
            In the previous section, most prominent risk factors of stroke was listed. This 
            is a very generalized and well known information. Are there any additional factors 
            that can influence stroke? 

            The lifetime risk of stroke is higher for women than men, with a 1 in 4 risk of 
            stroke for women after age 25. Can gender be a factor or can age be a factor? 
         </p>

         <p>
            In this section we will explore the influence of some of the well known factors 
            as well as some factors that are not listed above. 
            For the purpose of this study, a small dataset of about 250 stroke victims is chosen. 

         <ul>
             <li>Age <i>(factor not listed above)</i></li>
             <li>Gender <i>(factor not listed above)</i></li>
             <li>High blood pressure</li>
             <li>Obesity</li>
             <li>Heart Disease</li>
             <li>Smoking</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
            In the visualizations that follow, one can explore the direct impact of these
            <i>new</i> factors and also visualize the influence of other known factors when 
            the dataset is categorized based on Age and Gender.
