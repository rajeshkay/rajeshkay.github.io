         <p>
            The brain controls our movements, stores our memories, and is the source of our
            thoughts, emotions, and language. The brain also controls many functions of the
            body, like breathing and digestion.

         <p>
            To work properly, your brain needs oxygen. Your arteries deliver oxygen-rich blood
            to all parts of your brain. When something blocks blood supply to part of the brain
            or when a blood vessel bursts and that part of brain gets damaged, brain cells in
            that region start to die within minutes, because they canâ€™t get oxygen. This causes
            a stroke. A stroke can cause long-term disability, or even death.

            <br>

            The following webpages can provide a good start in better understanding
            of Stroke.

                   </a></li>
            </ul>


            Strokes can be classified into two major categories: 
            <ul>
               <li><b>Ischemic</b>: Ischemic strokes are caused by interruption of the blood 
                                    supply to the brain.
               </li>
               <li><b>Hemorrhagic</b>: Hemorrhagic strokes result from the rupture of a blood 
                                    vessel or an abnormal vascular structure.
               </li>

            </ul>

            About 87% of strokes are ischemic, the rest being hemorrhagic. Bleeding can develop 
            inside areas of ischemia, a condition known as "hemorrhagic transformation." It is 
            unknown how many hemorrhagic strokes actually start as ischemic strokes.

            Strokes are a life-threatening emergency, and immediate medical attention is
            critical. When there is a doubt, one MUST consult a doctor immediately.

            According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause
            of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. Over the years,
            several factors have been suspected to induce Stroke. The picture on the right captures 
            the most prominent risk factors of stroke.

            <i>Are there additional factors that can influence stroke?</i>
            For example, the lifetime risk of stroke is higher for women than men, with a 
            1 in 4 risk of stroke for women after age 25. So, <i> can <b>gender</b> be a factor or can 
            <b>age</b> be a factor?</i>

            In this section we will explore the influence of some of the well known factors
            as well as some new factors that are not prominently shown in the picture.

         <ul>
             <li>High blood pressure</li>

            A small dataset of about 250 stroke victims has been chosen for the purpose of this study.

            This section explore the direct influence of <b>Age</b> and <b>Gender</b> in the onset of 
            Stroke. This chart below will be able to provide a clue if <i>Females</i> are more vulnerable 
            to stroke than <i>Males</i> across some or all age groups.

            <br>
            <br>

            The <i>x-axis</i> of this chart depicts different age groups. The age groups are blocks of 10 years 
            starting from 30year olds through 90 year olds. The dataset did not have any stroke victim 
            above 90year old and below 30year old. The <i>y-axis</i> of the chart provides the total number of 
            stroke victims. For each age group along x-axis, there is a bar for adult Male(s) and a bar for adult 
            Female(s) presenting the total count of stroke victims per Gender for that age group.

            Obesity and Diabetes are already identified as risk factors for Stroke. BMI is a direct indication 
            of Obesity and Higher blood glucose level indicates diabetes. One unit increase in 
            body mass index (BMI) increases the risk of stroke by 5 percent. Diabetes can cause pathologic 
            changes in blood vessels at various locations and can lead to stroke if cerebral vessels are 
            directly affected. Additionally, mortality is higher and post stroke outcomes are poorer in 
            patients with stroke with uncontrolled glucose levels. This section presents the visualization 
            of BMI and blood glucose levels of adult stroke victims categorized by Age and Gender.  
            <br>
            <br>

            The y-axis of the chart represents Age of the victim at the time of stroke. The x-axis indicates 
            the blood glucose levels. The size of the marks (circles) indicate the BMI of the stroke victim.

            Someone who smokes 20 cigarettes a day is six times more likely to have a stroke compared 
            to a non-smoker. Common heart disorders can increase your risk for stroke. For example, 
            coronary artery disease increases your risk for stroke, because plaque builds up in the arteries 
            and blocks the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the brain. Also, High blood pressure or Hypertension 
            can cause the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the brain to burst or be blocked, causing 
            a stroke. This section offers an interactive visualization of smoking , blood pressure and heart  
            disease for different age group across men and women. An additional (less common) risk factor 
            <i>Residence Type</i> is also included in this chart. 

            <br>
            <br>

            This is a bidirectional chart. The x-axis of this chart shows different age groups. 
            The y-axis of the chart provides the count of stroke victims. For each age group, there is a bar 
            in the upward direction for Male and another for Female presenting the total number of stroke 
            victims per Gender for that age group. Based on the selection of <i>factor</i>, the downward 
            graph presents the count of men and women under different categories of the chosen factor.

            The color coding in this chart is uniformly applied across all risk factors (except residence type). 
            <font style="color:red">Red</font> implies that it is bad for health and <font style="color:green">green</font> 
            means it is either good for health or it does not have an impact to health. A different color scheme is 
            chosen for factors that may not have a direct impact to health (like residence type).

            <br>
            <br>

            The following sub-categories are present in each of the factor - 
            <ul>
               <li><a>Smoking Status: When filtered on <i><u>Smoking</u></i>, 4 categories for smoking are depicted -

		   </a></li></ul>

               <li><a>Heart Disease: When filtered on <i><u>Heart Disease</u></i>, the <font style="color:red">red</font> 
		      portion of each downward bar indicates the count of men/women who have a pre-existing heart 
		      disease while the <font style="color:green">green</font> portion provides the count of 
		      men/women without any heart issue. </a></li>

               <li><a>Hypertension: When filtered on <i><u>Hypertension</u></i>, the <font style="color:red">red</font> 
		      portion of each downward bar indicates the count of men/women who have high blood pressure 
		      or Hypertension while the <font style="color:green">green</font> portion indicates a 
		      healthy blood pressure. </a></li>

               <li><a>Residence Type: When filtered on <i><u>Residence Type</u></i>, aggregate measure is shown for 2
		      categories - sum of all stroke victims (men/women) residing in Urban area vs the sum of 
		      those living in rural area.</a></li>
